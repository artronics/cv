    Title & \textbf{Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSN)} \\[.3ex]

    Description& \small This project brings \textbf{Software-Defined Networking (SDN)} concepts in to \textbf{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)}. A \textbf{Client-Server} model connects each separated WSN to a \textbf{Centralized Controller} located in the Server. Client program exposes \textbf{REST} APIs to access Controller's resources. A \textbf{Single Page Application (SPA)} written in javascript (\textbf{Angularjs}) is in charge of monitoring the whole network. \normalsize \\&\\
    Significance & 
 \small\textbullet~Highly modular and loosely coupled design, written in Java.\normalsize\\&
 \small\textbullet~Cetralized Controller and Database.\normalsize\\&
 \small\textbullet~Clean and robust code; more than 200 unit tests with code coverage up to 80 percent\normalsize
